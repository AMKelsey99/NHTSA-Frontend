This is the HTML frontend of the NHTSA project that collects data from the NHTSA API using an AWS Lambda script, and stores it in an RDS-hosted MySQL database. 
For sharing purposes, all database credentials are removed from the repository.
This implementation uses the Django framework, and is intended to be hosted on an AWS EC2 server.
